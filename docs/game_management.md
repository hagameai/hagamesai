# Game Management Documentation

This document provides an overview of game management features within the `hagamesai` project. It covers game definitions, instances, and user interactions with the game services.

4. [API Endpoints](#api-endpoints)

## Game Definitions

Game definitions represent the blueprint of a game, including its rules, settings, and mechanics. In our API, a game definition can be created, read, updated, and deleted (CRUD operations). The following attributes are typically included in a game definition:

- **title**: The name of the game.
- **description**: A brief overview of the game's objectives and rules.
- **settings**: Configuration options specific to the game.

### Example of a Game Definition
```json
{
  "title": "Chess",
  "description": "A strategic board game played between two players.",
  "settings": {
    "time_control": "10 minutes",
    "board_size": "8x8"
  }
}
```

## Game Instances

A game instance is a specific occurrence of a game being played. Each game instance is created from a game definition and tracks the current state of the game. Attributes include:

- **game_id**: The identifier for the game definition.
- **players**: An array of users participating in the game.
- **status**: Current state of the game (e.g., ongoing, finished).

### Example of a Game Instance
```json
{
  "game_id": "12345",
  "players": ["user1", "user2"],
  "status": "ongoing"
}
```

## User Interactions

Users can interact with games through various actions such as:
- Joining a game instance.
- Making a move in the game.
- Leaving a game instance.

## API Endpoints

The following API endpoints are available for managing games:

- **POST /api/games**: Create a new game definition.
- **GET /api/games/{id}**: Retrieve a specific game definition.
- **PUT /api/games/{id}**: Update an existing game definition.
- **DELETE /api/games/{id}**: Delete a game definition.
- **POST /api/games/instances**: Create a new game instance.
- **GET /api/games/instances/{id}**: Retrieve a specific game instance.

## Conclusion

This documentation outlines the essential features and API endpoints related to game management in the `hagamesai` project. For further details, refer to the API reference documentation.
